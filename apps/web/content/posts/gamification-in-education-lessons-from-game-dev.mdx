## Introduction

Gamification introduces **game-like experiences** to improve engagement and motivation.

### What We Can Learn from Games

- Progress bars and achievements (like XP)
- Story-driven learning (quests, missions)
- Social features (leaderboards, teams)

## Tools to Start

- Phaser.js for simple web games
- Unity for 3D/AR experiences

## Caution

> Keep pedagogy first. Games are the tool, not the goal.

## Conclusion

Gamification bridges fun and functionâ€”**make learning addictive!**
